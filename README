The purpose of this project is to explore how to use cocos2d on android. 

I'm using cocos2d for android ported from cocos2d for iphone as an open source project here: http://code.google.com/p/cocos2d-android-1/

This project is an android application inspired from the 8-bit parachutes game (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0Thj5IyiY) I used to play as a kid. 

I've combined the parachutes game with the dynamic programming knapsack problem (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) such that you have a limited number of sacks or bullets to score a maximum score in a limited amount of time. If you shoot done a negative number, your score decreases. As simple as that!

NOTES:

- I'm using Parse for my backend : https://parse.com. In order to prevent anyone from using my keys, I have not uploaded the keys to the github repo. For the app to work and the android project to work without any build errors, you're going to have to add the keys to src/com/kajham/parachute/utils/KeyUtils.java
